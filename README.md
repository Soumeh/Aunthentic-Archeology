# Sniffer Changes
- More ancient plants, both decorative and functional; ideas are currently limited, more details on these later.
- Loot table for the sniffer depends on the biome or where it's found in a structure.
- Sniffers can be saddled and controlled.
- Sniffers sniff flowers.
- If a sniffer sniffs any ancient plant, it can dig up its seeds regardless of biome.

# Archaeology
- Artifacts and fragments.
- Ancient blocks.
- Peasant archaeologist.
- Geological hammer and suspicious stones.

# Artifacts and Fragments
- Depending on the biome, each structure with archaeology is assigned a type of fragment and a set of artifacts that can be found during excavations. Essentially, all structures in one biome share a common list of artifacts and fragment types for those artifacts.
- Artifacts can be both decorative and functional. Specific ideas for artifacts and ancient plants will be discussed later.
- Artifacts can be replicated using the corresponding type of fragment, similar to clay shards.

# Ancient Blocks
- Unique blocks found in archaeological structures.
- Can be used similar to banners' patterns, but in stonemasonry, to craft similar blocks (I'm still not entirely sure about this).

# Archaeologist
- A new villager profession (not sure yet which block will be needed, perhaps just a decorated pot).
- Trades artifacts, shards, etc., for emeralds and other artifacts.
- Clay shards and artifacts found directly during excavations, rather than copies, display "authentic" in the tooltip when hovered over.
- The archaeologist only accepts authentic artifacts and shards.
- Sells maps leading to archaeological structures.

# Geological Hammer & Suspicious Stones
- A new archaeological tool that cannot be crafted but can be found during excavations or purchased from archaeologists.
- Introduces a new type of suspicious block - suspicious stones (Suspicious Granite, Andesite, etc.).
- Loot can only be extracted from suspicious stone blocks using the geological hammer.
- The geological hammer cannot be used on suspicious sand, etc.
- To extract an item from a suspicious stone block, you need to constantly click on it with the hammer in hand, not just hold down right-click.
- Speed is crucial; clicking too slowly or stopping altogether will cause the artifact to get stuck back into the block.
- There's no limit on how fast you can click.
- Once the item reaches the final "popping out" stage, you must stop clicking, or it will be destroyed along with the suspicious stone.
- React in time, and the item will successfully drop from the block.

# Ideas for Ancient Plants
- Blue-flowered vines or something similar.
- Venus flytrap.
- A new type of tree.
- Slimevine capable of detecting slime chunks.
- Mushroom that changes the biome around it.
- Ancient pumpkin used to create vanilla golems with alternative appearances, as well as terracotta warriors, paying homage to the "clay soldiers" mod and the jukebox golem, which is basically a portable jukebox and everything.

# Artifact Ideas
- Creeper whistle that emits creeper sounds, repelling all mobs in a small radius.
- Ancient jukebox that uses the same records as a regular jukebox but plays different music.
