# Sniffer Changes
- More sniffer plants, both decorative and functional. (Plant ideas currently unfinished)
- Loot table for the sniffer depends on the biome or even being in a structure.
- Rideable sniffers for easier transportation.
- Sniffers sniff flowers nearby.
- If a sniffer sniffs any sniffer plant, it will dig up its seeds regardless of biome.

# Archeology
- Artifacts and fragments.
- Ancient blocks.
- Archeologist villager.
- Pick and suspicious stones.

# Artifacts and Fragments
- Depending on the biome, each archeology structure is assigned a type of fragment and a set of artifacts that can be found during excavations. Essentially, all structures in one biome share a common list of artifacts and a fragment type for those artifacts.
- Artifacts can be both decorative and functional. Specific ideas for artifacts and ancient plants will be discussed later.
- Fragments are used to make copies of their respective set of artifacts. (Ideas also currently unfinished)

# Ancient Blocks
- Unique blocks found in archeology structures.
- Blocks can be taken from their structure and replicated, possibly using a system similar to banner patterns, but in a stonecutter. (May be changed, point is they should be easily replicatable)

# Archaeologist
- A new villager profession (Not sure what would be the workstation, perhaps just a decorated pot).
- Trades artifacts, sherds, etc., for emeralds and other artifacts.
- Artifacts found in loot, rather than copies, display "authentic" in the tooltip when hovered over.
- The archaeologist only accepts authentic artifacts.
- Sells maps to archeology structures.

# Pick & Suspicious Stones
- A new archaeological tool that cannot be crafted but can be found in archeology loot or purchased from archaeologists.
- Introduces a new type of suspicious block - suspicious stones (Suspicious Granite, Andesite, etc.).
- Loot can only be extracted from suspicious stone blocks using the pick.
- The pick cannot be used on suspicious sand, etc.
- To extract an item from a suspicious stone block, you need to constantly right-click on it with the pick in hand, not just hold it down.
- Speed is crucial; clicking too slowly or stopping altogether will cause the artifact to retreat back into the block.
- There's no limit on how fast you can click.
- Once the item reaches the final "popping out" stage, you must stop clicking, or it will be destroyed along with the suspicious stone.
- React in time, and the loot item will be extracted.

# Ideas for Sniffer Plants
- The leaked vines that never got added.
- Some kind of Venus flytrap.
- A new tree type.
- Slime mold capable of detecting slime chunks.
- Mushroom that changes the biome around it.
- Ancient gourd used to create vanilla golems with alternative appearances, as well as terracotta warriors, paying homage to the "clay soldiers" mod and the jukebox golem, which is basically just a jukebox that follows you around.

# Artifact Ideas
- Creeper whistle that makes a creeper hissing sound, scaring away all mobs in a small radius.
- Ancient jukebox that uses the same music discs as a regular jukebox but plays different music.
